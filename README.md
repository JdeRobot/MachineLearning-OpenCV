# MachineLearning-OpenCV
This tool provides an application to test different Machine Learning algorithms over images. It uses OpenCV library functions. 

# Installation:
MachineLearning-OpenCV uses OpenCV and OpenCV_contrib libraries:
https://github.com/opencv/opencv
https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib

Besides it is necessary to install QT libraries.
For a correct performance it is necessary to build OpenCV library with Qt Backend support.
